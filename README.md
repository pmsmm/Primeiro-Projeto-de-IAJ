# First Artificial Inteligence For Games Project

Members The Participated in The Making of This Project:
- Pedro Maria (Github: pmsmm);
- Gonçalo Marques (Github: goncasmage1);
- Inês Vilhena (Github: Ines-Vilhena);

This project consisted in developing several collision avoidance algorithms such as:
- Avoid Character;
- Avoid Obstacle;
- Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle;
- Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle with Static Obstacle Avoidance;

At the end of implementing all of these algorithms we needed to use Unity's profiling mechanism to analyse performance of our code and improve it in any way possible.
